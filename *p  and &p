In fact , Variable “a ”is a symbol of storage unit .
CPU get access to the data of this Storage Unit through accessing the storage Unit’s address 
Hence, “a ” represent two different values : (1) the address of the storage Unit ,(2) the data inside the storage Unit .
C language set “a” as the data inside the storage Unit, &a is the address of storage Unit 

int a =5; int* ptr=a;就是错误的，指针不能接受一个值
int a =5; int* ptr=&a;才对，把a的地址给指针ptr

pointer need to point at address of the storage Unit ,it can not point at the data inside this storage Unit directly 

Pointer point to the address ,but pointer is not the address .
You can find the address through the pointer ,but you can not say pointer is the address
