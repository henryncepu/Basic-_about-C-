when using scanf  : 
  the difference between use & and without use it :
    -- int a ;
       char name[20];
       scanf("%s",name);
       scnaf("%d",&a);
     variable "a" is just used for storing the data ,if you didn't use &, it will not know where is the address of the Storage Unit
     name[] is an array ,and array is another type of pointer ,hence ,we can just input the data into array without & 
     
 when using printf :
   the difference between use & and without use it :
     every data can just be printed out without using & 
     if use &a ,the data will be something not related to your aim 
     
     for example : 
     int a ;
     a = 3
     printf("%d",a);
     printf("%d",&a);
     
     the result is :
     -3
     -1703724
